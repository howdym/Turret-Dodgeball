# This is a game that me and my partner, Kevin Wu made for our final project in our class COMP_SCI 211: Fundamentals of Computer Programming II. Unfortunately, the original file containing the final version of this game got wiped away and we are trying to recover it. For now, the version we have on this repository lacks documentation, minor feature adjustments (regarding rendering), additional test cases, and most importantly, detailed instructions. For now, here are some of the basic instructions on how to play the game. 

# Red player: Move with "WASD". Place/upgrade turrets using the space bar. 

# Blue player: Move with arrow keys. Place/upgrade turrets using the "/" key. 

# Each player has five lives. The first player that loses all their lives loses. 

# The game is located in the "src" file. Run the "main.cpp" file to start the game. 

# Have fun!
